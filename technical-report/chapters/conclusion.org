* Conclusion
  We have proposed a new permission of capabilities, the *uninitialized* permission. This permission
  only allows reading those parts of memory denoted by the bounds of the capability to which it
  has first written to. This prevents using the capability to read uninitialized data (be it garbage
  or sensitive data). We also provided a brief discussion of how to implement this on the /CHERI/
  capability machine. Finally we showed how uninitialized capabilities can contribute to
  secure calling conventions.
