## CShrink
Modified CShrink to take 3 arguments, `cd, cb, rt`, in which `rt` defines the new base.
Also included CShrinkImmediate, `cd, cb, imm` (imm: bits(11)), in which the new_base = cb.base + imm

This instruction is now the "counterpart" for `csetbounds`, but instead of targeting the top,
it targets the base.

## UCSC Instruction
Conflict with encoding, 0x3c was already taken for `opcode` field,
changed to 0x3d. Works now, cheri-mips and llvm updated.
Test added.

Useful command for instruction encodings from assembly:
`llvm-mc -assemble -arch=mips64 -show-encoding <assembly-file.s>`

## Technical Report
Second version done, send in for feedback.

## Thesis
Background section written.

## UCStore
Discussion of `ucsw $c11, $1, 0($c11)` vs `ucsw $c11, $1, -1($c11)`?
Former:
+ Works, all examples written using this style
- May be confusing the instruction uses offset 0 but real offset used is -size
- Cincoffset necessary when you want to write on the current address denoted by the cursor

Latter:
+ More intuitive
+ Should be trivial to change all examples to this new form
+ Doesn't require the cincoffset instr before writing on the cursor
- Requires modifying offset requirements (must be multiple of 1 for B, 2 for H, 4 for W, 8 for D)
  - Without this modification it will be just as confusing (`ucsw $c11, $1, -4($c11)` would write
	on cursor - 4 instead of cursor - 16 (size * signed(offset)))
