## CShrink
Encoding similar to CUninit but with 0b11100 for the _func_ field. (see cheri-mips instr encoding format)

Test written for this instruction see `cheritest/tests/uninitialized_capabilities/test_cshrink.{s,py}`.

## Uninit CC
See `thesis/info/uninit-calling-convention.org`, explains why cshrink is necessary.

The simple_example has been modified to use cshrink. (even though both instruction sequences
documented in uninit-calling-convention.org work in this example, it is better to use cshrink).

## Literature Review
First version is done, feedback?

## CC Template
First version is done, feedback? (cc template for cheri-mips)
Also written the cc details for Lau's CC.

## Technical Report
Have worked on it, but unhappy with my current section about capability machines,
need to improve this.
