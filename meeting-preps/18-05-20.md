## CShrink
Encoding similar to CUninit but with 0b11100 for the _func_ field. (see cheri-mips instr encoding format)

Test written for this instruction see `cheritest/tests/uninitialized_capabilities/test_cshrink.{s,py}`.

## Uninit CC
See `thesis/info/uninit-calling-convention.org`, explains why cshrink is necessary.

The simple_example has been modified to use cshrink. (even though both instruction sequences
documented in uninit-calling-convention.org work in this example, it is better to use cshrink).
