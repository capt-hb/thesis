## QEMU Build Fail

Solved, removed qemu + build files, reinstalled and now works again.

## Calling Convention Tests

It is not possible to create tests in the cheritest repo based on the current calling convention,
as seen in the llvm output of `c_files/simple_call.c`. The generated assembly is supposed to be run
on CHERIBSD.

Running tests on cheribsd should be straightforward once it is up and running, see the official 
cambridge page for how to run this (```$ cheritest # in cheribsd```).

Currently unable to test this, the cheribsd build is stuck at:
```
>>> Making hierarchy
```

## Calling Convention Implementation

Call Lowering happens in MipsISelLowering.cpp, see function LowerCall.

### Uninit Store Instr

TODO: modify LLVM to use the ucs[bwdh] cap store variants.
	  This requires a few modifications, in MipsInstrCheri.td
	  The current cs[bwdh] instrs are quite different, the ucs[bwdh]
	  variant has an out cap register, in case the cap was modified (cursor incr)

## Instruction Decoding Conflict

There was a conflict between 2 instructions (conflict occurred after updating llvm repo), in which
CGetPCCIncOffset and CGetUninit share the same instruction encoding.

This was easy to resolve by changing the decoding of CGetUninit to:

| Instruction | OPCode | Format | Source 1 | Source 2 | Destination | Function |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| CGetUninit  | 0x12   | 0x0    | rd       | cb       | 0x15        | 0x3f     |

Changes made in sail-cheri-mips and llvm.
