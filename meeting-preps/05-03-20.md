## Running Purecap Tests

The purecap tests can be run from the test folder: `tests/purecap`, the previous test file (`tests/uninitialized_capabilities/test_raw_original_calling_convention.s`) has been relocated
to this directory and the `raw` indication has been changed to `purecap`.

This also required adding this file to the purecap assembly sources in `Makefile.files.mk`.

## Writing Purecap Tests

In a purecap assembly file, the main entry point of the test is the `test` label. (for raw it was `start`)
It's also important to end the test with the following instructions:

```as
jr $ra # or cjr $c17 in CHERI
nop # branch-delay slot
```

This properly ends the test. Forgetting this results in errors.
