## Running Purecap Tests

The purecap tests can be run from the test folder: `tests/purecap`, the previous test file (`tests/uninitialized_capabilities/test_raw_original_calling_convention.s`) has been relocated
to this directory and the `raw` indication has been changed to `purecap`.

This also required adding this file to the purecap assembly sources in `Makefile.files.mk`.

## Writing Purecap Tests

In a purecap assembly file, the main entry point of the test is the `test` label. (for raw it was `start`)
It's also important to end the test with the following instructions:

```as
jr $ra # or cjr $c17 in CHERI
nop # branch-delay slot
```

This properly ends the test. Forgetting this results in errors.

## Original Calling Convention

This test is now fully running. It checks that the argument passed to `doSomething` is 100 and that the return value
is also 100.

Can be run with:

```bash
make pytest/sail_cheri_c/tests/purecap/test_purecap_original_calling_convention.py
```

## Uninit Calling Convention

Setup: copy the original calling convention `.s` and `.py` files (replacing `original` with `uninit`) and add the `.s` file to the purecap assembly sources
in `Makefile.files.mk`. Don't forget to modify the test class in the `.py` file to match the new filename.

The uninit calling convention can now be tested:


```bash
make pytest/sail_cheri_c/tests/purecap/test_purecap_uninit_calling_convention.py
```

### Modifications

#### Uninit Stack Pointer

Currently modifying the assembly code so that the stack pointer (`$csp`/`$c11`) is an uninit cap.
