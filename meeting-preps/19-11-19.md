## Semantics

### Representation

Unintialized capabilities are capabilities with an "uninit" permission.
So a capability with the uninit perm bit set to 1 is an _Uninitialized Capability_.

### Uninitialized + Sealed Capability

The uninitialized permission for sealed capabilities does nothing. 
A sealed cap is immutable, but uninit caps require mutability (behavior of the uninit cap
depends on the fields of the cap, e.g. cursor ([base,cursor[ = RW, [cursor,end]=W), therefore
a sealed uninit cap will exhibit the behavior of a sealed cap.

### Instructions

- _UCSplit_: Split an uninit cap on the given address, the uninit cap after the given addr
             would have cursor=base, while the uninit cap cursor remains the same
- _UCMerge_: Merge 2 uninit caps, they should be adjacent caps
- _CUninit_: Makes a cap uninit, throws error if cap is sealed
- _UCStore_: Stores in memory, only on cursor (and then advances cursor)
- _UCLoad_ : Loads from memory, only if base <= addr < cursor

## LLVM CHERI Instructions

Modifictions for new instructions:

Added instructions using the CHERI encodings, see `$LLVM/llvm/lib/Target/MipsInstrCheri.td` (CGetUninit + CUninit)
Memory characteristics defined in `$LLVM/llvm/include/llvm/IR/IntrinsicsCHERICap.td` (CGetUninit + CUninit)














































































































## Notes

Stack pointer can be uninit cap, should allow R for return pointer, adv can then store
it somewhere, but will never be able to read it again.
