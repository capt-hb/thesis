# Preparation Meeting November 8th

## Exceptions

I've added 2 new exceptions,

- CapEx_UninitViolation (see CToPtr)
- CapEx_UninitLoadViolation (see applicable Load Instructions)

## Instruction Semantics

_ACT (action) is either MOD (modification), ADD or NOP_
_Description describes the action to be taken, empty if NOP_
_V indicates done (V), todo (X) or optional (O) due to experimental instr_

Instructions in the following table appear in the same order as in `sail-cheri-mips/cheri/cheri_insts.sail`.

CSetAddr, CAndAddr alternative: do not allow derived uninit cap where newAddr > cursor.

### Clearing

For clearing memory between [addr, addr+off] it will be useful to introduce
a helper function in `cheri_prelude_256.sail`.
(see MEMw helper functions for clearing memory)

Or modifiy setCapOffset, incCapOffset and setCapAddr to include clearing of the capability
is an uninit cap.

## Instruction Encoding

An instruction encoding is proposed for the added instructions.
Added in decode clauses.

### CGetUninit

| Instruction | OPCode | Format | Source 1 | Source 2 | Destination | Function |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| CGetUninit  | 0x12   | 0x0    | rd       | cb       | 0x13        | 0x3f     |

### CUninit

Note: modifications done after meeting!

| Instruction | OPCode | Format | Source 1 | Source 2 | Destination | Function |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| CUninit     | 0x12   | 0x0    | cd       | cb       | 0x14        | 0x3f     |

## Assembly Files

Tests can be written in either assembly (`.s` files) accompanied with a python test file or in C.
The assembly/C file is used to create an ELF binary and is run on the emulator.

C files includes the test itself in the code, while the assembly file requires the use of a python test file
to actually test the contents of the registers (these are dumped after performing the assembly test code).

The emulator is always initialized with a `init*.s` file (can be `init.s`, `init_cached.s`, `init_multi.s`),
which sets up the stack and default exception handlers. (ELF binaries are created with the appropariate init file).

## Writing Tests

The `cheritest` repository has forks disabled, modifications are done in the uninitialized_capabilities branch.

### Uninitialized Capabilities Tests

Can be found in the `tests/uninitialized_capabilities` directory.
It currently just contains a copy of the `tests/alu/test_mult` test, to make sure it works.
Beware that the `TESTDIRS` variable needs to be adjusted to include the `uninitialized_capabilities` directory.
(`TESTDIRS` is set in `Makefile.files.mk`)

## Binaries

Using the tests, one can create binaries easily with the provided Makefiles (when running a test, the commands to build images are shown).

Example: 
```bash
$ cheri_c -l 1500000 --image $CHERITEST/obj/256/test_uninit_first.sailbin
```

The -l parameter is important, it indicates the cycle limit and is used for testing as well, otherwise
the emulator will perform instructions indefinitely.
After running this, a dump of the registers is printed to stdout.
