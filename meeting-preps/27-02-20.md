## Fix: Offset Increment

In the early stages of development I focused on single bytes, Dominique send an email that this was incorrect behavior.
I've fixed the mistake, see file `sail-cheri-mips/cheri/cheri_insts.sail`. (UCStore ^ UCStoreCap insts)

## Issue: Running Tests

Recently, I have been unable to run all the tests in `cheritest`.
This does however not seem to be due to my changes made to cheri-mips, llvm or cheritest. (temporarily reverted back to older versions resulted in the same errors)

## Calling Convention Tests

One more change needs to be made to get the tests to work: have the tests only run under the purecap ABI.
(prev problems occurred due to no stack/return pointer in $c11 or $c17)
