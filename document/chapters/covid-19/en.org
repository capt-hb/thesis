This master's thesis came about (in part) during the period in which higher education was subjected
to a lockdown and protective measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The process of
formatting, data collection, the research method and/or other scientific work the thesis involved
could therefore not always be carried out in the usual manner. The reader should bear this context
in mind when reading this Master's thesis, and also in the event that some conclusions are taken
on board.
