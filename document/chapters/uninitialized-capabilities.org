* Uninitialized Capabilities
  Uninitialized capabilities are a new type of capabilities. They are memory capabilities which 
  represent read-write authority to a range of memory, except that they do not allow reading the 
  initial contents of the memory. The memory first needs to be overwritten before it can be read.
  This type of capability requires a new permission to be added to capabilities 
  (*U*: uninitialized) and prevents the holder of the capability from reading memory that they have
  not first initialized. Figure \ref{fig:uninit-cap-concept} clarifies this concept a bit more.

  Formally, uninitialized capabilities grant the following authority:
  - permission to read in $[cursor, end]$;
  - permission to write in $[base, end]$;
  - when writing immediately below the cursor, the cursor will be decremented so that the holder of the 
    uninitialized capability is able to read from the location it has just written to.
    
  Uninitialized capabilities let the read range grow towards the base (after writing 
  immediately below the cursor), this reflects the way the stack grows. For MIPS, the stack
  grows downwards. If the stack grows upwards, the authority of uninitialized capabilities
  will need to be adjusted accordingly, having the read permission in $[base, cursor]$ and
  have it grow towards the end (when writing immediately above the cursor).

  The full set of permissions becomes (for a capability machines with local capabilities):
  - *R*: read-only;
  - *RW*: read, write;
  - *RX*: read, execute;
  - *RWX*: read, write, execute.
  - *RWLX*: read, write-local, execute.
  - *RWL*: read, write-local;
  - *U*: read between $[cursor, end]$, write between $[base, end]$;
  - *UL*: read between $[cursor, end]$, write-local between $[base, end]$;

  Combinations of the *U* permission and *X* permission are invalid, executing an uninitialized 
  capabilities would require incrementing the program counter (and thus the cursor of the 
  uninitialized capability), which means that the non-readable range of the capability would grow.
  Another option is to allow the combination of the *U* permission with the *X* permission, 
  but when jumping to an uninitialized capability transform it into a normal capability for
  the range $[cursor, end]$ before placing it in the program counter capability register.

** Implementation Overview
   This section gives an overview of the concrete design of uninitialized capabilities for the
   /CHERI/ capability machine, particularly the CHERI-MIPS ISA and the 256-bit capability format.
   However, the general concept is not limited to CHERI-MIPS or the 256-bit capability format.
   The concept of uninitialized capabilities is an addition to capability machines in general, and
   particularly the CHERI protection model, regardless of the architecture is it run on.

*** Uninitialized Permission Bit
    The first modification that needs to be made to CHERI capabilities is the addition of a new
    permission, the uninitialized permission. In the 256-bit capability format there are a few 
    unused bits (padding bits) available so one of those bits is now used for the 
    uninitialized permission, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:uninit-cap-rep}.

*** Instruction Modifications
    A few instruction were modified to take the uninitialized permission into account. What follows
    is a list of the instructions modified and a description of what that modification entails:

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Load via Capability Register (CL[BHWD][U]/CLC)*: When load instructions are given a capability
    with the uninitialized permission set, it is not allowed to load from an address lower
    than the cursor.

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Set/Increment Offset (CSetOffset/CIncOffset//CIncOffsetImmediate/CSetAddr/ \\
    CAndAddr)*: Instructions that modify 
    the cursor of an uninitialized capability are not allowed to set the cursor lower than it originally 
    was. The only way of lowering the cursor is by using the uninitialized store instructions.

*** New Instructions
    <<sec:new-instructions>>
    A few new instructions have been added for the implementation of uninitialized capabilities:

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Get Uninitialized Bit of a Capability (CGetUninit)*: This instructions has 2 parameters,
    the general-purpose register to store the uninitialized bit of the capability into and
    the capability of which the uninitialized bit is requested.

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Uninitialize a Capability (CUninit)*: An instruction to make a capability uninitialized.
    This instruction takes a source capability register and a destination capability register that
    will contain the capability from the source register but with the uninitialized permission set.
    An error will be raised if the original capability did not have read-write authority.
    
    The instructions to get the uninitialized bit and set it can be replaced by adding it to the
    existing set of permissions of capabilities. This would require a similar scheme as for local
    capabilities. Instead of having an uninitialized permission, the permission would indicate
    if a capability is initialized, i.e. capabilities would have a bit saying it is initialized
    if that bit is set and uninitialized if it is not set. This would allow making a capability
    uninitialized by using the /CAndPerm/ instruction, which will set the permissions of the
    capability to the logical ~&~ (and) of the current permissions of the capability with the
    permissions supplied in a general-purpose as argument to /CAndPerm/. The "initialized" bit
    can then be set to 0 (i.e. indicating the capability is uninitialized) by having the corresponding
    bit in the general-purpose be zero. This implementation choice is used for local capabilities,
    capabilities are local if the /global/ bit is unset.
    In this thesis the choice was made to use separate instructions for the unitialized bit,
    otherwise every occurence of the existing /CAndPerm/ instructions needs to be updated to make 
    sure that initialized capabilities remain initialized.

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Drop The Uninitialized Permission of a Capability (CDropUninit)*: This instruction allows making an uninitialized
    capability normal again, i.e. dropping the uninitialized permission, once the entire range denoted by the base and end
    of the capability has been written to. That means that if no uninitialized contents resides
    in the range of an uninitialized capability, then it is safe to drop the uninitialized
    permission of the capability. Using this instruction an uninitialized capability for an initialized
    array or struct can be converted into a capability without the unitialized bit set, which allows
    using negative increments for the offset (for example to loop with a pointer over an array starting
    from the end of the array towards the base of the array, which is not possible with uninitialized
    capabilities).
    
    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Uninitialized Store (UCS[BHWD]/UCSC)*: These instructions are modified versions of their
    not-uninitialized counterparts (CS[BHWD], CSC). They behave similarly to the normal
    store instructions, except when the given offset is $-1$ and the capability used for the store
    is uninitialized. In that case, the capability
    written to the destination capability register will have the cursor of the source capability 
    decremented by the number of bytes written (i.e. 1 for a byte, 2 for a half word, 4 for a word,
    8 for a double word and 32 for capabilities when using the 256-bit capability format). 
    Specifying an offset of $-1$ is the *only* way to decrement the cursor.
    This instruction takes 4 arguments, a destination capability register (which will contain
    the source capability but possibly with its cursor modified if the offset was $-1$), a source 
    register for the data to write, an offset and a source capability register.

    \bigskip
    The original store instructions for capabilities are *not* modified (CSC, CSW, ...), but instead 
    I propose to add new instructions to handle the uninitialized permission. The new instructions
    write to a capability register the possibly modified capability (if it has the *U* permission
    set and the given offset is $-1$), while the original instructions do not write to a register but
    instead allow specifying a register containing another offset to be added to the cursor of the
    capability.

    One additional instruction is required to modify the bounds of uninitialized capabilities:

    \bigskip
    @@latex:\noindent@@
    *Shrink a Capability (CShrink[Imm])*: CShrink is an instruction with 3 parameters, the destination
    capability register, the source capability register and a general-purpose register (GPR), or alternatively
    an unsigned immediate for CShrinkImm. The capability from the source register will be 
    modified by setting $end = cursor$ and $base = value\ in\ GPR$ for CShrink. For CShrinkImm
    $end = cursor$ and $base = base + immediate$. CShrink[Imm] will raise an exception if the
    $end < cursor$ (the original $end$ and $cursor$ of the capability) or if $newBase < base$, 
    these conditions prevent expanding the range of authority of the capability.
    
    \bigskip
    In the CHERI-MIPS ISA a similar instruction is already available, *CSetBounds*, but this 
    instruction did not meet the needs of uninitialized capabilities. It adjusts the bounds
    by setting $base = cursor$ and $end = cursor + immediate$, where immediate is either the value
    from the general-purpose register specified in the instruction or an unsigned immediate value.
    
    The issue with using this instruction in combination with uninitialized capabilities arises
    when trying to lower the $end$ of the uninitialized capability, but maintain the same $base$.
    Using CSetBounds this would require first setting $cursor = base$, calculate the offset
    for the new $end$, perform the CSetBounds instruction and then setting the $cursor$ back
    to its value before it was set to $base$. This obviously means lowering the cursor ($cursor = base$)
    which is not permitted for uninitialized capabilities.

** CHERI-MIPS ISA Extension
   The implementation of the design of uninitialized capabilities, as described in the previous section,
   has been instantiated for CHERI-MIPS in software (using a simulator).
   Each instruction will be given with its format, encoding, purpose, description,
   semantics, exceptions and optional notes. This is the same template as used in the CHERI technical
   report \parencite[chapter~7]{watson2019capability}.
   For the modified instructions only the modifications will be given for the template and a small
   description, for
   the complete information of the instruction, please refer to the CHERI technical report \parencite[chapter~7]{watson2019capability}.
   
   The semantics of each instruction will be shown by its Sail code. Sail is an imperative programming 
   language that is used to describe instruction set architectures. Sail can generate a simulator
   from the sail code (in OCaml or C) but can also generate code for theorem provers \parencite[page~167]{watson2019capability}.
   Note that in the semantics section of each instruction, the common definitions are hyperlinks 
   (in red) to the corresponding type and explanation of a function in Appendix [[appendix:sail]].
   It is not required to understand these definitions to understand the code, the name of each
   function should be descriptive enough to understand more or less what it does.
